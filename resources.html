    <h3>Implicit Bias Training</h3>
    <p>This type of training should be mandatory for medical students and healthcare providers and administrators alike to partake in.
    The goal of this training is for these healthcare professionals to gain knowledge of implicit bias and understand how that affects their patients, 
    whether it be emotionally, mentally, or physically. This is to ensure
    that they are working rationally which will reduce health disparities. </p> 
    <p>The training would include: </p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Attending Seminars</li>
        <li>Interviews</li>
        <li>Regular Self-Evaluations</li>
        <li>Conducting Research</li>
        <li>Practicing Mindfulness</li>
    </ul>
